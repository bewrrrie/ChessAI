# ChessAI

My implementation of ASCII chess game with opponent AI.

### Current goals
- [x] Implement chess board and pieces
- [X] Implement pieces moves
- [ ] Implement checks, checkmates and draws
- [ ] Implement opponent AI using minimax criteria (there is a nice [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/simple-chess-ai-step-by-step-1d55a9266977/) about it and another two also nice articles: [first](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1515) and [second](https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1940))

### How to build
To build this project [Haskell Tool Stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack) is required. 
```
$ stack build  
$ stack exec functional
```
